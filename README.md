# Word Unscrambler JS
Currently takes approx 100 milliseconds to perform an 8 letter unscramble.  
There are also larger word lists out there and there is most likely a better way to do this.  
Will work on more optimizations.

### What It Does

Enter a selection of scrambled letters such as `adesfghytp` and receive a list of words that those letters can form.  
This runs entirely in the browser and does not require a database or serverside computation.

### Why?
Honestly I wanted to cheat my favourite word game.  
It is an interesting problem that may require a data structure and some clever thinking.

### What I learned...
It is a good idea to Make tools to generate code for you.
Needs more optimization.
